# IP2ORG2IP

IP2ORG2IP is an IP to organization name and organization name to IP resolution service. Our goal is to research how IP to Organization attribution services and DNS resolution works by implementing our own service that provides both, while trying to address some problems that current services face

### Features

- IP2ORG lookup, allowing a set of IP's at given dates to be input
- ORG2IP lookup, allowing a set of organization names at given dates to be input

These services together provide historic, bulk attribution services, which addresses a key issue of current attribution services


### Importance
IP2ORG and ORG2IP resolution services play a crucial role in the operation of the Internet, providing valuable information regarding domain names, IP addresses, organizations, and autonomous systems. Specifically to networking, these services provide great tools to assist in network troubleshooting, as well as investigations of cyber security incidents
